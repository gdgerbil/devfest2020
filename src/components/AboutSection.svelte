    About DevFest
  </h2>
  <p>
    DevFest 2020 brings together thousands of developers globally for the
    largest virtual weekend of community-led technical learning and a shared
    passion for technology. The magic of DevFest has always come from the people
    involved - developers from all different backgrounds and skill levels. For
    DevFest 2020, Google Developer Groups are coming together in a whole new way
    - virtually over one weekend. This global moment empowers developers to
    teach, learn, and connect when they may need it the most.

    DevFest Erbil 2020, is organized by the GDG Erbil Team.
